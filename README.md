# Shopping-Carts
In this lab you build a fully‑functional shopping‑cart interface using only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates the core concepts of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic state management without any external libraries or frameworks.

## The user can:

1. Browse a list of dessert products that are generated dynamically from a products array.
2. Click an Add to Cart button on any product to add that item to the cart.
3. See the cart UI toggle between “Show” and “Hide” when the Cart button is pressed.
4. View the number of items, subtotal, tax, and total in the cart summary.
5. Clear the entire cart after confirming the action.

All cart logic (adding items, calculating totals, applying tax, and clearing the cart) is encapsulated in a ShoppingCart class, keeping the code organized and test‑friendly.
